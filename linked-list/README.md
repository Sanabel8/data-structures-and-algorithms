# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Linked List :1. sequence of Nodes each Node references the next Node in the link.
             2. A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Verify Big O(1) of written code.

Verify code matches algorithm.

## API
Methods in LinkedList Class
insert(Node newNode): This method accepts a Node parameter and its purpose to add a new Node in the LinkedList.

isInclude(Node head, int value): This method accepts a Node parameter and int parameter and its purpose to test our Nodes' values if they are found so the test gives us true or return false.
