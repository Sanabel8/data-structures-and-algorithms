# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Binary Tree Data Structure has elements and each elemnt has at most 2 children and each child called left and right child. Each Node contains:

1.Data
2.Pointer to left child
3.Pointer to right child

Traversals: Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node and print out the contents of a tree.

Depth First Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the height of the tree first. There are three methods for depth first traversal:

1.Pre-order: root >> left >> right
2.In-order: left >> root >> right
3.Post-order: left >> right >> root


## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
** This challenge about how to build a binary tree, store Nodes in it and apply Depth First methods. Also how to build binary search tree class contains add() method and contains method.

Methods in Binary Tree class
. postOrder(Node node): depth-first traversal to print and store the nods in array list by left >> right >> root way.
. inOrder(Node node ): depth-first traversal to print and store the nods in array list byleft >> root >> right way.
. preOrder(Node node): depth-first traversal to print and store the nods in array list byroot >> left >> right way.

Methods in Binary Search Tree class
. add(int key): Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
. contains(int key): Returns boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
. traverse (Node current, int key): Check the value from add() method to put it in the right location.
